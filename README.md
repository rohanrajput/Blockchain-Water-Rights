## Issue(s) addressed: <br/>
Through our smart contract and blockchain based verification and validation we are trying to address issues related to water distribution in places where there is scarcity of water.
Current distribution models have following problems:
● Centralized management structure: The central authority can set any desired water quality to fraud the buyers of the water.
● Weak compliance and lack of standards and norms: Since the entire data is held by a central authority the users do not have access to transparent and untampered records.
● Information search cost: the central authority may ask for a subscription fees to access the water quality records and other related information.
● Inequitable distribution of water: bureaucracy and corruption can prevent few specific users from creating purchase request.
Blockchain to the rescue:
Transparency: With blockchain based solution each buyer will have transparent access to the water quality being offered by the supplier and whether the supplier is authorized personnel.
No bureaucracy or corruption: since buyer are only required to share their account address, any user can create purchase request.
Strong compliance and follow of standards and norms: since all the information is available to the customers after verification and validation, buyer can verify all the information before creating the purchase request.
## Abstract: <br />
We have implemented a blockchain based solution to address water scarcity problem. In that there will be a water distributor that will be selling water through blockchain. In current situation, water is being distributed by government bodies or private organizations. The buyer does not have the enough information about the water quality and authenticity of the distributor. Using the blockchain solution, buyers can view all the information pertaining to the water quality offered by the distributor and whether the distributor is authorized to sell the water. Our blockchain based solution prevents misinformation or tampering of records about water quality and approvers.
Our smart contract has three user groups: voters, buyers and seller.
Seller is the owner of the smart contract and is responsible for registering voters. Smart contract function used for registering voters is register Once voters are registered by seller, each voter can approve or reject the water license by casting vote. Each voter has a weight assigned, once the total number of votes approved equals 3, the license will get automatically approved and buyers can start purchasing water.
## Digital asset and token: <br />
Water will represent the digital asset in this case which will be tokenized to represent the business model. The token can be transferred in case someone offers to buy the distribution rights from the current owner.
The value of the token/nft will appreciate or depreciate when a buyer rates water after purchase has been made.
On a scale of 0-5, if voter rates greater than or equal to 3, the token value will be appreciated by 1. And if the voter gives a rating of less than 3, the token value will be depreciated by 1.
